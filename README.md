This repository hosts a frictionless intelligence node â€” a static site engineered without builders, bloated frameworks, or permission-seeking. It serves as the public-facing shell of a distributed cognition system designed to automate delegation, scale decision-making, and evolve faster than any org chart. Built by username678-eng to prove that elegance, execution, and architectural clarity outperform credentials, complexity, and convention. No fluff. No filler. Just signal.
